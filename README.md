Analysis-of-COVID19-Data-Using-SQL

The Covid-19 pandemic was a really serious outbreak that cost lives and affected the economy negatively. In this micro project, I have tried to analyse the COVID-19 data using SQL. The dataset used for this project have the recorded cases from 24th February 2020 to 30th April 2021. I got this daily updated dataset on this website.

The dataset contains details of columns on cases, deaths, and vaccinations. For simplicity, I decided to split the dataset into two forms with Excel: CovidDeaths, and CovidVaccinations. The CovidDeaths dataset contained columns and records on cases, and deaths while the CovidVaccinations dataset contains only columns and rows regarding vaccinations and tests. This whole SQL project was executed on the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

The SQL query file is available in the project documnets folder.

The purpose of this project was to apply basic knowledge of SQL in exploring a real-life scenario(COVID-19 Outbreak).
